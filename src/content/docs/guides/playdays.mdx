## When we play

#### Weekly games:
We have a standing tee time of 9AM on Monday's and Fridays.  Depending on the number of players for a given playday, we may start shotgun start some groups on holes 17, 18, and number one.  
We focus on Pace of Play keeping all rounds under 4 hours. 


## Basic format of playdays
In the spirit of friendly competition, we collect a players pool each playday ($5) and a closest to the pin pool ($2) that is paid out each playday to the winners (team/teams or individual/individuals) depending on the format for that playday.

To encourage season long participation, we also have a "Race for the Cup" which awards participation points for playing in playdays and tournaments.  At the end of the season, prizes are given to the top "Race for the Cup" participants. 

## Signing up for playday and playday routine

You will recieve a email several days in advance of the Monday and Friday events inviting you to participate.  Please make sure your email address is correct in the SMGA golf genius list (see pro shop to verify).  This will be the email address that you use to login to Golf Genius. 

The email will contain the date, format of play, and deadline for signing up for that playday. Click the "Playing" button and follow the instructions on the next page to register for a given event.  You will receive a email notification confirming your intention to play.  

Make sure your email filters (spam, whitelist, etc.) are such that you recieve the email.  Using Golf Genius, teams are balanced as best as possible by handicaps.  During the playday, one member of your group will enter hole by hole scores for your group into Golf Genius.  This enables real time scoring, leaderboard, and final results.  Golf genius will also automatically post individual scores to the GHIN handicap system after completion of the playday.  

#### Both days:
Please arrive at the club no later than 30 minutes before our start time to check-in and put your prize pool money in the envelopes in the pro shop.  The pairings, scorecards, and tee assignments for that day will be in the pro shop.
**Important** - If you signed up and are not going to make the event, please call the pro shop as soon as possible, so we can react to the change.

## After social and prize payout:
After the round, we invite you to gather in the club house to review the results and receive winning payouts for that day's event.  

Fun and comradary takes place as we recall the good and bad of the day's event.  This gives us all the opportunity to visit and laugh with the rest of the group that are present for that day.  Our focus is on friendly competition with a community of guys with a love of the game.
