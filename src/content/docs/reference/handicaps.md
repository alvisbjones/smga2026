## Handicap procedures and info:

* SMGA members must have a USGA GHIN (Golf Handicap and Information Network) membership through the Hills pro shop.
* A $5/month fee is assessed each member for administrative costs by Prestonwood.
* All rounds must be entered into GHIN ASAP, before midnight, on the day of play whether at home or away.  This includes all personal rounds as well as SMGA play days and tournaments.
* This includes 9 hole rounds (7 holes minimum) and 18 hole (14 hole minimum).  Unplayed holes will be scored as par plus whatever handicap strokes player is entitled to on said hole(s).
* Entering scores hole by hole is preferred.
* Net double bogey max on any given hole, SMGA events included.

## How are handicaps determined?
* Each round played results in a Score differential (measures performance to relative difficulty of the course)
* Score Differential = (113 / Slope Rating for tees played) x (Adjusted Gross Score - Course Rating)
* Adjusted Gross score = all strokes played to net double bogie max per hole.
* Handicap index is the average of your best 8 score differentials (from last 20, )
* If less than 20 total scores see:  <a href="https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/handicapping/world-handicap-system/topics/handicap-index-calculation.html" class="button">Less than 20</a>
* Course Handicap=(Handicap Index x (Slope Rating/113)) + (Course Rating – Par)
* Hills green tees slope rating is 128 and course rating is 67.9.  Par is 72.
