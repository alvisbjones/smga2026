## Core tennants of golf
Each hole starts with a stroke from the teeing area and ends when the ball is holed on the putting green (or when the Rules otherwise say the hole is completed).

For each stroke, the player:

* Plays the course as they find it
* Plays the ball as it lies.

But there are exceptions where the Rules allow the player to alter conditions on the course and require or allow the player to play the ball from a different place than where it lies.
For example - Movable objects & loose impediments.  see attached video:

## Points of emphasis for our group and local rules
The USGA rules of golf consist of 25 rule sections each covering an aspect of the game. For our group we want to place emphasis on the following rules where people may have some confusion.

### Rule 1 & Rule 9 - Play the ball as it lies
Often referred to as **"playing the ball down"** - this is our default unless notified otherwise.

Playing the ball “Down” means that you do not get to move or roll your ball to secure a better lie, or clean and replace your ball. Exceptions are if the ball is on rocks or roots and is a safety or equipment issue.  “Winter Rules” or “Special Playing Condition Rules” must be declared prior to any play.

### Rule 2 - The course
Teeing area (Green default):

We primarily play the **Green Tees**. 
You may play the **Blue Tees** as long as you inform the Pro Shop or Game Day Manager when you sign up prior to play. This is to insure the proper Handicap Index.

80+ years of age: 

You may choose to play the Red/Green Tees.  If Red/Green combo Tees are chosen you must inform the Pro Shop or Game Day Manager when you sign up prior to play, so the correct tees are selected for you in Golf Genius.

Moveable objects & Abnormal conditions (objects or conditions that interfere with play):
See the following short videos for clarification:

" class="button">Abnormal conditions</a>




### Rule 3 & Rule 6 - The Competition, Playing a hole
 PUTT THE BALL UNTIL HOLED 

However, for pace of play, the SGA allows you to pick-up any putt that is inside 18 inches. As designated by yellow tape on your putter. Do not give puts or declare “that’s good” without measuring.
Tournaments have alternate rules that require you to hole all puts.

COUNT ALL YOUR STROKES (net double max)

However, for pace of play- pick up or end your play on a hole if your next stroke is for a net double bogey. This applies as well if you are still in the fairway and have not reached or have no chance of reaching the green before carding a net double bogey.
Record the gross score on the hole as a net bogey.  For example, on a par 4, if you have one handicap stroke, you record a 7. Alternative scoring rules apply only if designated by the pro-shop - prior to play.

We play under the "Handicap competition rules".

HANDICAPS:

All SMGA Members are governed by the rules and expectations of The Clubs of Prestonwood Handicap Committee to responsibly and accurately maintain their Handicap.
On Monday Play Day (non- Golf Genius days) – players are responsible for recording their scores into the GHIN system.
Friday and Tournaments that are scored in Golf Genius are automatically uploaded into GHIN.
Non HSMGA play should also be recorded into GHIN as governed by the Prestonwood Handicap Committee.



### Rule 4 - The Player's equipment
Player must use conforming clubs and balls, and is limited to no more than 14 clubs.

The player may not change a golf ball on the hole being played, and only substitute another ball on the hole being played if it can be clearly seen that the original ball is cut, cracked or significantly damaged. 



### Rule 5 - Playing the round (Pace of play)
The SMGA has a point of emphasis on pace of play.  As a group we strive to complete the round in under 4 hours.  Please limit unnecessary practice swings and play "ready golf"

5.6b recommendation - Be prepared to make a stroke, make a stroke within 40 seconds if not faster

### Rule 12 - Bunkers
Loose impediments:

You may remove loose impediments before the stroke.

Touching the sand:

Before playing a ball in a bunker, a player must not:

Deliberately touch sand in the bunker with a hand, club, rake or other object in order to test the condition.

### Rule 16 - Relief from abnormal course conditions (Ground under repair)

Taking relief (Ground under repair - white markings, temporary water, unmovable obstructions:

If you find your ball in a area marked with white paint (ground under repair), or temporary water the following video gives a quick overview of your options:

### Rule 17 - Penalty areas (Red vs Yellow stakes)
Penalty areas are defined as either red or yellow and this affects your options.
The following video shows your options for both types of penalty areas:

### Rule 18 - Stroke and distance (Out of bounds, Lost ball, Local rule)
We allow the option of using Stroke and distance relief or the optional Local rule for a lost ball or ball out of bounds.  If you suspect your ball is lost or out of bounds after hitting a shot, considering hitting a provisional ball in these cases.  In either case, a 3 minute search time is in effect.

**Stroke and distance relief**

Player should take stroke and distance relief by adding one penalty stroke and playing from where the previoius stroke was made.  This is a situation where playing a provisional ball will prevent you having to backtrack to play another shot.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEwNzgC9ge4" class="button">Stroke and distance relief</a>

**Local rule relief**

Player has the option to use the **Local Rule** as an alternative to stroke and distance relief.  If this option is taken, drop the ball in the vicinity of where the ball is lost or out of bounds (including the nearest fairway area) not closer to the hole, under a two-stroke penalty.

**Example**

Option 1 - Player suspects lost or out of bounds off of the tee.  Hit a provisional from tee and search for ball.  If lost or out of bounds, the provisional becomes your ball in play and you are lying 3 about to hit your 4th shot.

Option 2 - Player suspects lost or out of bounds off of the tee and opts for the local rule.  Go to the nearest point on the fairway to the lost or out of bounds ball and take a two stroke penalty.  You will be hitting your 4th shot.

### Rule 19 - Unplayable ball

UNPLAYABLE LIE: a one stroke penalty

If a ball comes to rest; against a tree, in a bush, against a Homeowners Fence, etc. and cannot be played. 
You cannot move, bend or break any growing or attached natural object, 
The player may take unplayable ball relief using one of the three options in each case adding one penalty stroke.
* Use stroke and distance relief and replay from spot of previous stroke 
* Back on the line relief - on the line between unplayable ball and hole as far back as desired
* Lateral relief two club lengths from unplayable spot, no closer to the hole
